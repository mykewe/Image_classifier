# Image_classifier

This is my attempt at the Udacity deep learning project for Udacity's introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree". 

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers with over 98% accuracy on the test set. The classifier is then exported first for a command line application and then a web application using streamlit and later deloployed with Heroku. A web application can be found here https://flowerclass-app.herokuapp.com/
